<h2 id="whoami">Who am I?</h2>
<p>I am an introvert that really likes playing games, (no longer in the middle of class) and has like no friends. I don't have a very kind liking of Colton.</p>
<br><br><br>
<h2 id="whatido">What I like to do</h2>
<p>I really like coding. My favorite coding languages are:
  <ul>
    <li>Python</li>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
<h>What these coding languages are is explained in the <a href="#definition">definitions section</a>.

<h2 id="games">My favorite games</h2>
<h3>Red Dead Redemption 2</h3>
<img src="reddead2.jpeg">
<p>I love Red Dead Redemption 2 because of how immersive and realistic it is. I also love it because it is very emotional. Even for the fourth time. </p>
<h3>Minecraft</h3>
<p>The reason I love Minecraft is because of how unlimited it is. You can basically do or build what you want, when you want.</p>
<h3>Roblox</h3>

<h4>Disaster Island Survival (DIS)</h4>
<p>The reason I like DIS is because there are a lot of items and maps to use. There are also a lot of disasters so some funny moments can happen.</p>
<h4>Bloxburg</h4>
<p>Bloxburg is honestly a pretty cool game because you can build houses with almost anything.</p>
